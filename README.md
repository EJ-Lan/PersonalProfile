# PersonalProfile
the 'Personal Profile.' It's a web project I've undertaken as part of the BTM 418 course at the University of Alberta.

The 'Personal Profile' is essentially a dynamic website that serves as a comprehensive overview of my background, skills, and experiences. It features dedicated sections for an 'About' page, showcasing my personality and interests, a 'Skills' section highlighting my competencies, an 'Experience' section detailing my professional journey, and a 'Contact' section for easy communication.
